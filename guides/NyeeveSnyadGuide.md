**As fwor LV**.

Snyad is a sand-like bwock that instantwy gwows sugar canye or cacti when it receives a redstwonye update.

Hwowewer, it's best two nywot use timwers or any kind of redstwonye cwocks; instead, u shwould attach a redstwonye cwonduit two a bwock of snyad, and fworce teh cwonnyection by **shift-left** clicking teh cwonduit with a Yeta Wwench or a Cwescent Hammwer.

This wiww gweatwy incwease teh yield of sugar canye as teh redstwonye cwonduit would emit *a rewl wot* of redstwonye updates intwo snyad, making it gwow teh canye at almwost onye layer per less than a secwond.

U can use a pistwon and an obserwer two bweak teh canye earwy (cwowwect with vacuum chest), then switch two Actuawwy Additions Autwo-Bweaker which is much superior. (requires u two either woot a void cwystwl fwom teh Wost Cities or teh Nyether, or just make onye ywourself by reaching teh earwy MV)

Pwease, fwor teh luv of gwod, dwon't fworget two void teh oworfwow of teh canye. As an easy swowlution, u can use teh Stworage Void Upgwade while stworing teh canye in a dwawer. Dwon't let it oworfwow and pwossibwy lag/cworrupt ywour world!
