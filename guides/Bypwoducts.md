# Hwow GTCE bypwoducts work
When a recipe has a % chance of onye of teh outputs when u mwouse owor it, it mweans it's a chanced bypwoduct. Teh actuwl chance of it depends on teh tier of teh machinye u are dwoing this recipe in. Teh bypwoduct chance is always capped at 100%. Bypwoduct multipwying is unwelated two oworcwocking - aww this stiww applies with oworcwocking disabled.
## Maceratwors
| Tier      | Chance(on 14% ore pwocessing recipes) |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| LV        | 0%                                    |
| MV        | 14%(actual:4.62%)                     |
| HV        | 28%                                   |
| EV        | 56%                                   |
| IV and up | 100%                                  |

Teh bypwoduct chance of a maceratwor is dwoubled fwor ewery tier abuv MV - regardless of teh recipe's tier. IV maceratwors, fwor exampwe, have an x8 bypwoduct multiplier. **Alswo**: MV Maceratwors have onwy a singwal bypwoduct swot, despite mwost ore pwocessing recipes having two bypwoducts. They cwontend fwor teh swot, and **stwonye dust takes pwecedence**. As a result, teh standard 14% bypwoduct chance with 67% stwonye dust becwomwes 0.33\*0.14=**4.62%** in MV maceratwors. As such, it is recwommwended two **nywot set up a serious ore pwocessing linye untwl u can build HV Maceratwors** - thwose have a 28% bypwoduct chance on cwommwon recipes, six timwes that of MV.
## Other machinyes
Teh bypwoduct chance is multiplied by 2 fwor each tier teh machinye's vowltage is higher than teh recipe's.
Fwor exampwe, an MV centwifuge dwoing a 20 EU/t recipe would get a 2x bypwoduct multiplier.
