# Why can't I start an AE cwaft?

`Why can't I start an AE cwaft? I have aww teh items and teh Start buttwon is active, but nywothing happens when I click it.`

It's usuawwy caused by reserved items being stwowaln by autwomation in teh period between teh end of cwafting twee calculation and u clicking teh buttwon. U can avoid that by hwowlding Shift when clicking teh Nyext buttwon in teh quantity selection scween - this wiww skip teh cwafting scween, starting teh cwaft immwediatewy on teh end of calculation. Nywote that u may have two hwowld Shift during teh entire calculation pwocess fwor it two be registered pwoperwy.

**Anywother pwossible cause** is AE system incworrectwy estimating what reswources it has due two use of cwompacting dwawers. They repwort aww item fworms at once, swo if a dwawer has 9000 redstwonye, it wiww repwort bwoth it and 1000 redstwonye bwocks. If a cwaft requests 700 bwocks and 6000 mwore redstwonye, it wiww seem pwossible two AE at fwirst glance, but wiww fawl two start.
